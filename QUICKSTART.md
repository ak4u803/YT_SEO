## Tips for Success

### ✅ Do's
- ✓ Run analysis before uploading new videos
- ✓ Re-analyze videos periodically (trends change!)
- ✓ Use a mix of suggested and trend-based tags
- ✓ Adjust settings based on your goals
- ✓ Pay attention to all metrics, not just the score

### ❌ Don'ts
- ✗ Don't use too many generic tags
- ✗ Don't ignore trend analysis
- ✗ Don't forget to update old videos
- ✗ Don't use tags unrelated to your content
- ✗ Don't analyze too many videos quickly (rate limits)

## Common Issues

### "Invalid YouTube URL"
**Solution**: Make sure you copied the full URL from the browser address bar

### "Transcript not available"
**Solution**: This is normal for some videos. Analysis will still provide suggestions based on title, description, and tags.

### "Trend analysis unavailable"
**Solution**: Wait 1-2 minutes between analyses to avoid rate limiting

### Application won't start
**Solution**: 
```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

# Check Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.9+
```
