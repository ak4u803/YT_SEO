## Technical Details

### Architecture

The application consists of four main modules:

1. **main.py**: GUI application and orchestration
2. **youtube_analyzer.py**: Video data extraction and metadata parsing
3. **seo_engine.py**: SEO analysis and tag generation using NLP
4. **trend_analyzer.py**: Real-time trend analysis using Google Trends

### Data Sources

- **YouTube**: Video metadata, transcripts, and engagement metrics
- **Google Trends**: Search trend data, related queries, and rising topics
- **NLP Analysis**: TF-IDF vectorization, keyword frequency, and phrase extraction

### Privacy & Data

- All analysis is performed locally on your machine
- No video data is stored or transmitted to third parties
- Trend data comes from public Google Trends API
- Settings are saved locally in `settings.json`

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid YouTube URL"
- Ensure the URL is complete and properly formatted
- Try copying the URL directly from the browser address bar

### "Transcript not available"
- Some videos don't have transcripts (disabled by creator or auto-captions unavailable)
- Analysis will still work but may have fewer tag suggestions

### "Trend analysis unavailable"
- May occur due to rate limiting from Google Trends
- Wait a few minutes and try again
- Try analyzing with fewer/different keywords

### Import Errors
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Update pip: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
- Try installing packages individually if bulk install fails

### NLTK Data Errors
- The application downloads required data automatically
- If issues persist, manually download:
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
```

## Limitations

- **Rate Limiting**: Google Trends API has rate limits; avoid analyzing too many videos in quick succession
- **Transcript Availability**: Not all videos have transcripts
- **Metadata Access**: Some video metadata may be restricted or unavailable
- **Trend Data**: Trend analysis requires active internet connection
