# Machine Learning-Based Tag Prediction

## Overview

The YouTube SEO Analyzer now includes advanced **Machine Learning-based tag prediction** that uses state-of-the-art AI models to intelligently suggest tags for your videos. All models run **locally on your computer** and require **no API keys** or external services.

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. **Zero-Shot Classification**
- Uses Facebook's BART model (facebook/bart-large-mnli)
- Automatically categorizes your content into relevant YouTube categories
- Categories include: tutorial, review, gaming, entertainment, education, technology, and 20+ more
- Provides confidence scores for each category prediction

### 2. **Semantic Similarity Analysis**
- Uses Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model)
- Finds phrases semantically similar to your video title
- Understands meaning, not just keywords
- Extracts contextually relevant multi-word tags

### 3. **Clustering-Based Discovery**
- Uses K-means clustering to group related content
- Discovers hidden patterns in your video content
- Generates representative tags from each content cluster
- Helps find tags you might not have thought of

### 4. **Context-Aware Extraction**
- Analyzes sentence structure and context
- Identifies important phrases based on frequency and position
- Extracts meaningful multi-word combinations
- Prioritizes phrases that appear in important contexts

## 🚀 How It Works

### Tag Generation Pipeline

1. **Content Analysis**
   - Extracts text from title, description, and transcript
   - Combines all text sources with weighted importance (title gets 3x weight)

2. **ML Processing**
   - **Step 1**: Zero-shot classification identifies content categories
   - **Step 2**: Semantic similarity finds related phrases
   - **Step 3**: Clustering discovers hidden tag groups
   - **Step 4**: Context analysis extracts important phrases

3. **Quality Assessment**
   - Calculates diversity score (variety of words used)
   - Measures tag quality (mix of specific and broad tags)
   - Provides confidence scores for predictions

4. **Tag Explanation**
   - Shows why each tag was predicted
   - Indicates which methods contributed to each tag
   - Helps you understand the AI's reasoning

## 💻 Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.9 or higher
- At least 2GB of free disk space (for models)
- 4GB+ RAM recommended

### Installing ML Dependencies

```bash
pip install transformers sentence-transformers torch
```

Or install everything at once:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### First-Time Setup

The first time you run the application with ML features:
1. Models will be automatically downloaded (this may take 5-10 minutes)
2. Models are cached locally in `~/.cache/huggingface/`
3. Subsequent runs will be much faster (no re-download needed)

**Note**: During first run, you'll see messages like:
```
Loading ML models (this may take a moment on first run)...
Downloading model files...
ML models loaded successfully!
```

## 📊 Using ML Tag Prediction

### In the GUI

1. **Analyze a Video**: Enter a YouTube URL and click "Analyze Video"

2. **View ML Tags**: Go to the "SEO Suggestions" tab

3. **ML-Predicted Tags Section**: 
   - Shows AI-generated tags at the top
   - Displays quality metrics (Quality Score, Diversity %)
   - Lists top 5 tag explanations

4. **Copy Tags**: Click "Copy ML Tags" to copy only ML-predicted tags

### Understanding the Output

#### Quality Metrics
- **Quality Score (0-100)**: Overall tag quality
  - 80-100: Excellent diversity and specificity
  - 60-79: Good mix of tags
  - 0-59: Consider using more tags or different content

- **Diversity Score (%)**: How varied your tags are
  - Higher is better
  - >70%: Excellent diversity
  - 50-70%: Good diversity
  - <50%: Tags may be too repetitive

#### Tag Explanations
Each ML tag comes with an explanation:
- "appears in title" - Tag is directly from the title
- "found in description" - Tag appears in description
- "ML-predicted category" - AI categorized the content this way
- "semantically relevant to content" - AI found this contextually related

### Example Output

```
[ML Predictions] | Quality: 85/100 | Diversity: 73%

python tutorial, programming, coding guide, software development, beginner python, 
web development, data science, machine learning, coding tips, python basics

━━━ Top ML Tag Explanations ━━━

• python tutorial: ML-predicted: appears in title, semantically relevant to content
• programming: ML-predicted: ML-predicted category, found in description
• coding guide: ML-predicted: semantically relevant to content
• software development: ML-predicted: ML-predicted category
• beginner python: ML-predicted: semantically relevant to content
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Models Used

| Model | Purpose | Size | Speed |
|-------|---------|------|-------|
| facebook/bart-large-mnli | Zero-shot classification | ~1.6GB | Fast |
| all-MiniLM-L6-v2 | Sentence embeddings | ~90MB | Very Fast |

Both models:
- ✅ Run completely offline after initial download
- ✅ Require no API keys
- ✅ Are free and open-source
- ✅ Use CPU inference (works on any computer)
- ✅ Are maintained by trusted organizations (Meta/Facebook, Hugging Face)

### Performance

**First Run:**
- Model download: 5-10 minutes (one-time)
- Analysis per video: 30-60 seconds

**Subsequent Runs:**
- Analysis per video: 10-30 seconds
- No download needed

### Memory Usage
- Idle: ~100MB
- During ML analysis: ~2GB
- Models on disk: ~1.7GB

## 🆚 ML vs Traditional Tags

### When to Use ML Tags
- ✅ For semantic understanding (meaning over keywords)
- ✅ When you want AI-suggested categories
- ✅ To discover tags you might not think of
- ✅ For content with rich transcripts
- ✅ When targeting broader audiences

### When to Use Traditional Tags
- ✅ For exact keyword matches
- ✅ When focusing on specific phrases from your content
- ✅ For niche topics with specialized terminology
- ✅ When you want full control over tag selection

### Best Practice
**Use both!** ML tags and traditional tags complement each other:
- ML tags provide semantic breadth
- Traditional tags provide keyword precision
- Combined approach maximizes discoverability

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "ML tag prediction not available"
**Cause**: ML libraries not installed

**Solution**:
```bash
pip install transformers sentence-transformers torch
```

### "Error loading ML models"
**Cause**: Insufficient disk space or network issues

**Solution**:
1. Ensure you have 2GB+ free disk space
2. Check internet connection for first-time download
3. Try clearing the cache: `rm -rf ~/.cache/huggingface/`

### "Analysis is slow"
**Cause**: First-time model download or CPU-only inference

**Solutions**:
1. **First run**: Wait for models to download (one-time)
2. **Subsequent runs**: ML analysis takes 10-30 seconds (normal)
3. **Optional**: For faster inference, install CUDA if you have an NVIDIA GPU

### Models won't download
**Cause**: Network restrictions or firewall

**Solution**:
1. Check firewall settings
2. Try downloading from a different network
3. Manual download: Visit https://huggingface.co/ and download models to `~/.cache/huggingface/`

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### Data Privacy
- ✅ All processing happens **locally on your computer**
- ✅ No data is sent to external servers (after model download)
- ✅ Video content stays on your machine
- ✅ No tracking or analytics

### Model Security
- ✅ Models from trusted sources (Meta/Facebook, Hugging Face)
- ✅ Open-source and peer-reviewed
- ✅ Widely used in production (millions of downloads)
- ✅ No executable code in model files

## 📈 Advanced Usage

### Programmatic Access

```python
from ml_tag_predictor import MLTagPredictor

# Initialize predictor
predictor = MLTagPredictor()

# Prepare video data
video_data = {
    'title': 'Your Video Title',
    'description': 'Your description',
    'transcript_full': 'Full transcript text'
}

# Get ML predictions
results = predictor.predict_tags(video_data, num_tags=30)

print("ML Tags:", results['ml_tags'])
print("Category Scores:", results['category_scores'])
print("Quality Metrics:", predictor.analyze_tag_quality(results['ml_tags']))
```

### Customization

You can customize the ML predictor by modifying `ml_tag_predictor.py`:

**Add custom categories**:
```python
self.tag_categories = [
    "tutorial", "review", "gaming",  # existing
    "your-custom-category",  # add your own
]
```

**Adjust number of clusters**:
```python
# In _cluster_based_tags method
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=10, random_state=42)  # default is 5
```

**Change similarity threshold**:
```python
# In _extract_semantic_tags method
semantic_tags = [candidates[i] for i in top_indices if similarities[i] > 0.2]  # default 0.3
```
